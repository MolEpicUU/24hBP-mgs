# scripts

Contains the analysis scripts.

* 01_preaparing_data.R has been used to process the data for the analyses performed in SCAPIS genearting the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and non-ABPM subsamples.
* 02_alpha_diversity.R has been used to generate the alpha diversity analysis results for ABPM subsample.
* 02_alpha_diversity_validation.R has been used to generate the alpha diversity analysis results for non-ABPM subsample.
* 03_species_24_bp_crude_modelV01.R has been used to generate the Model 1 analysis results for the associations between species and 24-hour blood pressure outcomes for ABPM subsample.
* 03_species_24_bp_multiple_modelV01.R has been used to generate the Model 2 analysis results for the associations between species and 24-hour blood pressure outcomes for ABPM subsample.
* 03_species_24_bp_multipleBMI_modelV01.R has been used to generate the Model 3 analysis results for the associations between species and 24-hour blood pressure outcomes for ABPM subsample.
* 03_species_office_bp_multiple_modelV01.R has been used to generate the Model 2 analysis results for the associations between species and office blood pressure for ABPM subsample.
* 04_fgsea.R has been used to generate the enrichment analysis results for taxonomic genera and gut metabolic modules (GMM).
* 05_species_BMI.R has been used to generate the Model 2 analysis results for the associations between species and body mass index (BMI) for ABPM subsample.
* 06_sensitivity.R has been used to generate the sensitivity analysis results.
* 07_species_BP_multiple_model_validationV01.R has been used to generate the Model 2 analysis results for the associations between species and office blood pressure for non-ABPM subsample.
* 07_species_BP_multipleBMI_model_validationV01.R has been used to generate the Model 3 analysis results for the associations between species and office blood pressure for non-ABPM subsample.
